1. Generate sample dataset
	[
//	    [ time, low, high, open, close, volume ],
	    [ 1415398768, 0.32, 4.2, 0.35, 4.2, 12.3 ],
	    ...
	]

	- vary the number of data points per second. 
		[0..N]    make N variable.  Default 5.
	- make total time for data set configurable 
		Default to 300 sec (300sec / 60sec = 5min)

	
2. Set up Node JS webserver to serve up sample data 
	- emit data point every 10ms

3. Write Java client to connect to webserver through a websocket

	- onMessageReceive(String data) is invoked when when server sends us new data item
	- prase data: create data object responsible for parsing JSON string and eposing data elements
	- process data: 
		if multiple data points in 1 sec
			keep highest
			leep lowest
			sum up the volume
		if no data point within 1 sec 
			use data from previous sec

	- store data:
		one data entry per second

	- decide: shouldIBuyEther() is called from main method evey second
		logic TBD
